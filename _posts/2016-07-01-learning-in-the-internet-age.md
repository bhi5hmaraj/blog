The internet has [sparked](https://youtu.be/N4mdV1CIpvI?t=14m20s) one of the largest changes to education. People have [completed an entire MIT Computer Science curriculum](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) in a span of a year. Things which would sound ridiculous 2 decades ago are now so mainstream. But I felt that there hasn't been much awareness about the amount of stuff that's out there mostly free in the internet. Though most of the resources here are written from the perspective of a computer science student I am sure that people with other interests will also find something engaging. 

## Procrastination and Good introduction

Lets start with a good [xkcd](https://www.xkcd.com/731/) comic

| Resource                                                     | Topics                       | Notes                                                        |

| [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) , [what-if](https://what-if.xkcd.com/) | Mixed                        | A very popular webcomic series by Randall Munroe. "A webcomic of romance,  sarcasm, math, and language". His what-if series is very interesting and anyone with a curious mind will absolutely love it. |
| [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/featured) | Math                         | Watching these amazing visuals is such a pleasure. He has a knack for explaining math concepts with great visuals. His essence of linear algebra and calculus is a must watch. |
| [Vsause](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce)                | Mixed                        | The channel host Michael, is a really fascinating guy. The topics he choses for the videos are very quirky and thought provoking. He usually picks up topics which are not so popular hence we can always learn something new any interesting. |
| [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium)       | Science, Technology          | The content in veritasium is very similar to vsause. In fact there are a few videos where |
| [Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q) | Philosophy, Science, History |                                                              |
| [Quora](https://www.quora.com/)                              | Mixed                        | I guess Quora needs a post of it's own. It's basically a knowledge sharing website where people post questions and others answer them. This is by far the closest we can get to the minds of some of really cool people. This question answering site is very addictive once you start following some top writer in your areas of interest. |
| [Crash course](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse)     | Mixed                        | I feel this channel covers the most breath of topics amongst all the resources listed here. John Green's lectures in big history are really good |
| [Minute Physics](https://www.youtube.com/user/minutephysics) | Physics                      | Short videos which concentrate mainly on physics.            |
| TED talks                                                    | Mixed                        | Keynote type talks which are mostly given by academics to popularize their work. Their talks are known for their [contrarian](https://www.wired.com/2013/04/tedtalk/) stance. |

## Active Learning 

The above resources are good to get started/interested to a topic but the real learning happens only when we get our hands dirty. The [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning) article has good amount of information regarding this topic.

[Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy , Vanderblit University](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/)

| Resource                                                   | Topics                                   | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Khan academy](https://www.khanacademy.org)                | Mixed                                    | Salman is literally a genius. He explains concepts really well. Given that he started this to teach his (if I'm not mistaken) cousin , his pegadogy is really great. The videos are geared towards the hows and whys. Super helpful when you have no clue what the teacher is saying at school or when you want to get a intro to a topic. |
| [Brilliant.org](brilliant.org)                             | Predominantly math but also physics      | Brilliant has a good collections of wiki pages for a lot of math topics. Their problem collection is also quite good. |
| [Art of Problem solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) | Math                                     | It's more focussed towards olympiad type of math problems. Well known for it's active discussion forums. |
| [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about)            | Math                                     | Good resource if you're interested in number theory and want to [get better](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/06/how-i-failed-failed-and-finally-succeeded-at-learning-how-to-code/239855/) at programming |
| [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)                       | Programming, Problem solving, algorithms | The most active competetive programming community as of now (2018). Has really good problems with varied difficulties. Their contests are a |
| [codingbat](http://codingbat.com)                          | Programming                              | One of the best ways to learn a programming language. They have a lot of beginner friendly programming puzzles with the focus of getting better at java and python. |
| [codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)                      | Programming                              | Similar to codeforces . The long contest which they host every month for 10 days is one of the best ways to push yourself to learn new concepts. The joy of solving a really hard problem after days of hard work is unparalleled. |
| reddit                                                     | Mixed                                    | Discussions are an integral part of the active learning framework and reddit is perhaps the largest forum on the planet. Since users have the option to remain anonymous, sometimes the discussions get little out of hand! |

## The Big Guns

Internet has probably created an education system which is highly scalable and cheap , the massive open online courses (MOOCs) . Ususally in most of the courses  A lot of prestigious institution such as Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Caltech already have many interesting courses without the loss of any rigour. But as with any medium , there are a cases where the quality of teaching is sub par . So do lookout for reviews in sites such as [class-central](https://www.class-central.com/) , [mooc-list](https://www.mooc-list.com/) to get a better idea of the courses before enrolling. 

| Resource                                            | Notes                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)               | Coursera was pivotal in the success of MOOCs . Most of the courses are of top quality and the faculty members actively participate in the discussion forums. |
| [EdX](https://www.edx.org/)                         | Very similar to Coursera . But has more skill based courses. |
| [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)            | A lot of popular courses in MIT are recorded and along with their lecture notes, assignments and solutions are made available for free online. |
| [Stanford Lagunita](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/) | It's basically a edX platform with courses from Stanford.    |
| [NPTEL](http://www.nptel.ac.in/)                    | Indian version of Coursera. This site offers courses from IITs , IISc and other prestigious institutes from India. It follows a semester style of classes. There is an option to pay and write exams |
|                                                     |                                                              |

I would like to emphasis that MOOCs have their own share of disadvantages. Some MOOCs are very shallow in their curriculum. Hence even after completing the courses, we don't get a in depth understanding of the subject. All the resources that I have mentioned above are more of a supplement to the traditional school/university .
