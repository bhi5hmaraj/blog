1. Start learning linear algebra and probability ASAP
2. Math elitism is common and get used to it faster 
3. Don't get stuck in the comfort zone. Get used to the DTPE (Def, Theorem, Proof, Exercises) pipeline fast.
4. At a more abstract level most areas in theoretical CS are very similar on how they are structured. Hence don't waste a lot of time in choosing a topic. This is probably because a lot of research skills (problem solving, mathematical maturity, different levels of proof comprehension, getting a high level idea of the paper/topic) that you develop in a particular area is transferable to another one. 
5. Don't think math as just a bunch of results that we can just use in CS theory. Instead math provides a good playground for improving maturity which is required in a lot of theory courses. 
6. [CMI's growth mindset culture](https://sci-hub.se/http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295X.95.2.256) - This one made a huge difference in my world view. Pretty much no one judges you for not knowing something if you're putting in the effort to learn.
7. Don't take words like "trivial", "obvious", "it's easy to see that " too seriously. I think this a tactic used here to recalibrate your scales of what's hard and easy. There is a an oppurtunity to swap out better mental models.  
8. Math books and most TCS books assume some mathematical maturity. The exposition of these books slightly differ from the way engineering books do. Engineering books motivate the applications first before delving into the details/concepts (i.e. a top down approach). But OTOH math/tcs books follow a bottom up approach. Due to this somwtimes it might be frustrating to see why the author is stating a particular lemma/theorem. I think one gets used to this as they are exposed to it. I found the advice on this [book](https://epdf.pub/how-to-think-about-analysis.html) quite useful. 
9. Proof Comprehension - I used to think that the authors came up with the proofs the same way they have written in the book. But that's far from true. Usually the final proof in the books are highly polished versions which are selected for elegance and space. Hence 
10. Imposter Syndrome - 
11. Delayed Gratification - Proofs generally give delayed gratifications compared to a program which works. 
12. Pure math is kind of like playing with LEGO blocks. And most of mathematics is aimed towards making things trivial by going up the scale of abstraction.
