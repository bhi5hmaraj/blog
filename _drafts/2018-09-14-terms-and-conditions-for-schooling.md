Ok where do I even start to rant about schooling !

> Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.

This is precisely what I should have done in school. 

Ok first let me clarify a few assumptions that I have made in this rant

- By schooling I meant the traditional school system
- I'm not targetting any particular school or board in general. 
- The first impression a student gets about a subject lasts forever. 
- Another disclaimer that I would like to point out is that people might point out that inspite of these flaws the current system is churing out great people. By answer to that they are suffering from [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) .
- My only concern is that how many students could we have potentially got into a field if they had a good teacher in the first place. 
- I feel that the problem is in the way lectures are administered itself. Lot of time in school is devoted to passive learning (you just have to listen and maybe take notes) . But that's not where the real learning takes place. Real learning (active learning) takes place when you discuss and think hard about a problem.
- This is exactly where tuitions/coaching centers excel at. This is what puzzles me a lot. 
- Too much emphasis is given to drills and memory retention. 
- Next comes the exams and instruments of grading.

- I feel that the current state of education system at least the one I've been thorugh , is a sinking Titanic. But the sad fact is that most passengers don't yet know that it's a sinking ship ! Instead of finding ways to make it afloat, isn't it wise to just board a life boat ? But 
- Too much of power/dependency is given to a single individual
- For example let's say Alice's first exposure to math was scared by a bad teacher . The way math is structured is that a lot of topics are interrelated to each other and it is built upon the material taught earlier. Hence there is a high chance of Alice hating math as she might have had a very traumatic experience in an earlier class. 
- Maybe it's a conspiracy theory by irrational people to reduce the chances of people learning critical thinking.
- I could 

Schools - A place where human turing machines are programmed. Too much emphasis on drills. Reduce emphasis on arithmetic. More emphasis on critical thinking and reasoning. 



Assignments should be allowed to be discussed



Is it so obvious or am I missing something

Online resources should supplement school content.
