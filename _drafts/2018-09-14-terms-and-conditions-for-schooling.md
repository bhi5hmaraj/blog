Ok where do I even start to rant about schooling !

> Rebellion is almost as stupid as obedience. In either case you let yourself be defined by what they tell you to do. The best plan, I think, is to step onto an orthogonal vector. Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job. As day jobs go, it's pretty sweet. You're done at 3 o'clock, and you can even work on your own stuff while you're there.

This is precisely what I should have done in school. 

Ok first let me clarify a few assumptions that I have made in this rant

- By schooling I meant the traditional school system
- I'm not targetting any particular school or board in general. 
- The first impression a student gets about a subject lasts forever. 
- Another disclaimer that I would like to point out is that people might point out that inspite of these flaws the current system is churing out great people. My answer to that they are suffering from [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) .
- My only concern is that how many students could we have potentially got into a field if they had a good teacher in the first place. 
- I feel that the problem is in the way lectures are administered itself. Lot of time in school is devoted to passive learning (you just have to listen and maybe take notes) . But that's not where the real learning takes place. Real learning (active learning) takes place when you discuss and think hard about a problem.
- This is exactly where tuitions/coaching centers excel at. This is what puzzles me a lot. 
- Tight feedback loops helps a lot when we are learning something new
- Too much emphasis is given to drills and memory retention. 
- Next comes the exams and instruments of grading.

- http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/25/factory-model (arguments against factory model)
- I feel that the current state of education system at least the one I've been thorugh , is a sinking Titanic. But the sad fact is that most passengers don't yet know that it's a sinking ship ! Instead of finding ways to make it afloat, isn't it wise to just board a life boat ? But 
- Too much of power/dependency is given to a single individual
- For example let's say Alice's first exposure to math was traumatized by a bad teacher . The way math is structured is that a lot of topics are interrelated to each other and it is built upon the material taught earlier. Hence there is a high chance of Alice hating math as she might have had a very traumatic experience in an earlier class. 
- Maybe it's a conspiracy theory by irrational people to reduce the chances of people learning critical thinking.
- Incentivize caching of results rather than thinking from first princliples. But I guess it is kind of justified given the fact that the incentives for schools themselves is flawed (they just have to maintain a decent average and have a single star performer)
- Another important fact I observed is that a sense of dogmatism and conformity which gets propagated in schools. I am not sure if this a remenent of the english schooling system

Schools - A place where human turing machines are programmed and also tested on who is the fastest. Too much emphasis on drills. Reduce emphasis on arithmetic. More emphasis on critical thinking and reasoning. 



Assignments should be allowed to be discussed ()



Evidence from Bloom's taxonomy . 



Online resources should supplement school content.

Probably it is necessary to have a very thourough drills and repetitions for solidiying concepts but I feel teachers should try to acknowledge the fact that it is not sufficient enough to have a solid understanding of a subject. I feel board exams and schools instill a false expertise.

Another reason I feel that things have stayed this way is because of incentives for schools. Historically schools primary academic barometer is the board exams. I would like to make a case against why it might not be the most accurate and  they have never moving outside their comfort zone. 

BTW the idea and motive of the schooling system is great. Damn, only rich/royal families had access to education before enlightenment or renaissance. The current system of education. But not all is lost, in the current age of internet motivated and smart kids can learn most of the elementry concepts on their own. 

School should spend more time teasing and making students understand why they are learning something. By the end of a year students should be able to make out the forest for the woods.
