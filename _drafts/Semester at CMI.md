# Semester at CMI

Time surely flies like an arrow ! 

I just started my 2nd semester at CMI. Last semester I took 5 courses . Algorithms, Mathematical Logic, Theory of Computation, Introduction to Programming using Haskell and Theoretical Introduction to Computer Science. 

Overall the semester went pretty great.
