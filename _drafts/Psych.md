### Introduction and Personal Background

I'm a 22 year old male from Madurai. Currently pursuing a masters in computer science from Chennai Mathematical Institute. I completed my B.Tech (CS) from Shiv Nadar University, Noida.  

I have a had a cursory interest in Psychology for the past couple of years. In fact I have changed a lot in the past 2.5 years. Started getting my feet wet in philosophy and psychology. I haven't done any formal courses or have read complete books in these areas. But I have taken a couple of courses in Coursera namely [Introduction to Philosophy from The University of Edinburgh](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy/) and [Introduction to Psychology from The University of Toronto](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psych) . Though I was not able to complete them,  I now have a better idea of the fields than just reading popular articles. 

This document contains some of the pressing questions which I have been facing for the last 2 years. I have attached links to resources wherever possible. 



- Intelligence
  - **My current understanding and views**
    - Glanced through this book "Intelligence: A Very Short Introduction by Ian J. Deary"
    - Going through this article "Intelligence : Known and Unknowns" (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232430439_Intelligence_Knowns_and_Unknowns)
  - **Problems faced**  
    - Need to know my competency to plan and go about things effectively. This would help massively in building confidence and self-esteem.
    - Without knowing the reality, I tend to reside in the extremes (either over or under confident) and both have negative impacts. 
    - Having a better model helps during discussions or external attacks during social situations
    - I feel knowing ones strengths and weakness has huge repercussions in planning, self-confidence,  
- Learning, Goals, Motivation
  - **My current understanding and views**
    - Have some understanding of Carol Dweck's work on Mindset, Angela Duckworth's work on Grit. 
    - Have some basic understanding of “The Procrastination Equation” by Dr. Piers Steel
    - I am interested in how humans set goals and achieve them. 
  - **Problems Faced** 
    - Having a better model of learning has the obvious compounding effect.
    - A better understanding of goal setting and planning reduces a lot of inefficiencies 
    - In recent times, I have formed a meta theory that most problems in life can be reduced to a psychological problem. 
    - One of my biggest enemies resides here, Procrastination/Akraisa
    - Recent times I have been facing a massive attention crisis. I sometimes feel that I might have ADD. I would be reading something, suddenly get distracted into working on something else. My browser used to have nearly 30 open tabs. I have noticed this phenomenon especially in the mornings and late nights. My brain is in some sort of exploration state. Clicking at every interesting link it could get it's hands on. I have spent some time trying to find it's cause. I guess it might be due to my past where I had to forcefully constraint myself into concentrating at my academics. This was during my first 3 years at college. At school I thought I had mastered all the subjects, but then when I encountered actual programming problems I realized how much the education system had failed me. I felt a strong sense of betrayal. So I had to put the responsibility upon myself and had to learn things on my own. Also having not so good teachers didn't help much. So for a couple of years I had a live a double life of managing college and also improving my actual problem solving skills by taking online courses. So for 2 years I was very narrow minded. I guess this has created a sort of deficit which my brain is trying to fill. 
- Depression and Anxiety 
  - I haven't put much thought into it. But I can now self-diagnose when I'm under one. 
  - I guess I have had 2 major episodes of depressions. One was 
- Social
