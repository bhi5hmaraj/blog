### Welcome to my blog! 

I'm Bhishmaraj, currently pursuing a master's degree in (Theoretical) computer science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=bhishma). I completed my undergrad in computer science engineering from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/). I hail from Madurai, India. 

_Fun trivia_ - [De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan#Childhood) was born is Madurai. 

My main interests broadly includes algorithms and problem solving. Not so long ago I used to game a lot. It's funny right now that I even owned a PS2 and a PS3. But for the last 3 years it has been replaced with competitive programming. I found it to be more addicting and interesting than gaming. I'm a die hard fan of MOOCs. I find them to be a really good way to get introduced to new subjects. Hence you'll find most of my posts revolving around these topics. 

The main reason for starting the blog is to keep track of the stuff I'm currently working and also pen down my musings. As English is not my native language, I plan to improve my writing through this blog. If you find any grammatical errors do let me know in the comments.



##### Regarding the name of the blog  

>The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)

It's such a common phenomenon, yet not many people know about this. So I wanted to kind of popularize the term. But this is just the tip of the cognitive biases iceberg. Recognizing these biases can help us in making better decisions and also to mitigate irrational behavior.
