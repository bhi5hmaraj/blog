## Welcome to my blog! 

<img src="{{ "/images/profile_pic_2019.jpg" | relative_url}}" alt="Profile picture" height="300px" width="300px"/>


I'm Bhishmaraj, currently pursuing a master's degree in ([Theoretical](https://introtcs.org/public/lec_01_introduction.html)) computer science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=bhishma). I completed my undergrad in computer science engineering from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/). I hail from Madurai, India. 

_Fun trivia_ - [De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan#Childhood) was born is Madurai. 

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithms (approximation, randomized and parameterized). 

Not so long ago I used to game a lot. It's funny right now that I even owned a PS2 and a PS3. But for the last 3 years it has been replaced with competitive programming. I found it to be more addicting and interesting than gaming. I'm also a die hard fan of MOOCs. I find them to be a really good way to get introduced to new subjects. Recently me and my friends got interested in [indoor rock climbing](https://goo.gl/maps/ngSee2YXmvx2m1kR6).

The main reason for starting the blog is to keep track of the stuff I'm currently working and also pen down my musings. As English is not my native language, I plan to improve my writing through this blog. If you find any grammatical errors do let me know in the comments.



##### Regarding the name of the blog  

>The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)

It's such a common phenomenon, yet not many people know about this. So I wanted to popularize the term. But this is just the tip of the [cognitive biases iceberg](https://yourbias.is/). Recognizing these biases can help us in making better decisions and also to mitigate irrational behavior.
