## Welcome to my blog!

I'm Bhishmaraj, currently pursuing a master's degree in ([Theoretical](https://introtcs.org/public/lec_01_introduction.html)) computer science at [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/student-profile.php?id=bhishma). I completed my undergrad in computer science and engineering from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/). I hail from Madurai, India. 

_Fun trivia_ - [De Morgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_De_Morgan#Childhood) was born is Madurai. 

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, especially algorithms (approximation, randomized and parameterized). I dabble a bit in psychology and am interested in it's interaction with CS. In fact biology has influenced a lot of computational constructions such as [finite automaton](https://www.dlsi.ua.es//~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf) , neural networks and [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) to name a few. Hence naturally I find the [cognitive sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science_) to be particularly interesting. 

Not so long ago I used to game a lot (even owned a PS2 and a PS3 !). But for the last 3 years it has been replaced with [competitive programming](https://www.stopstalk.com/user/profile/bhishmaraj). I found it to be more addicting and interesting than gaming. I'm also a huge [fan](https://bhi5hmaraj.github.io/blog/learning/2018/07/01/learning-in-the-internet-age.html) of MOOCs. I find them to be a really good way to get introduced to new subjects. Recently me and my friends got interested in [indoor rock climbing](https://goo.gl/maps/ngSee2YXmvx2m1kR6).

The main reason for starting the blog is to keep track of the stuff I'm currently working and also pen down my musings. As English is not my native language, I plan to improve my writing through this blog. If you find any grammatical errors do let me know in the comments.



#### Regarding the name of the blog  

>The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)

It's such a common phenomenon, yet not many people know about this. So I wanted to popularize the term. But this is just the tip of the [cognitive biases iceberg](https://yourbias.is/). Recognizing these biases can help us in making better decisions and also to mitigate irrational behavior.
