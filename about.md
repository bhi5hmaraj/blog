### Welcome to my blog! 

I'm Bhishmaraj, a computer science undergrad from [Shiv Nadar University](https://snu.edu.in/). My main interests include algorithms and problem solving. Not so long ago I used to game (read COD) a lot. But for the last 3 years it has been replaced with competitive programming. I found it to be more addicting and interesting than gaming. I am a die hard fan of MOOCs. I find them to be really good way to learn new things. Hence you'll find most of my posts revolving around these topics. 

The main reason for starting the blog is to keep track of the stuff I'm currently working and also pen down my musings. As English is not my native language, I plan to improve my writing through this blog. If you find any bugs or grammatical errors do let me know in the comments.

Regarding the name of the blog "Curse of Knowledge"
 
>The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.
